# PureBasic
 PureBasic code and programs made by Me. Handy Apps and Tools, games, and also various examples.

 To compile these source files you will need the PureBasic compiler http://www.purebasic.com

 Apparently 'code signing' is a thing. Unfortunately I DO NOT have $500 for a code signing certicate.
 So if you wish to download and run ANY of these files or code be WARNED you will get Fake AV warnings, OR the code/program
 may not work at all. You have been advised.
